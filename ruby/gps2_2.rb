# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
  # create a new hash with default value of 1.
  # iterate through the string adding values to the new hash. 
  # print the list to the console [use print the list method.]
  # return hash
# output: hash

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: list, item name, and optional quantity
# steps:
# check to see if item is already in the list.
# if it is on list, incriment item.
# if it is not on the list,add item to list with stated quantity to the existing hash.
# output: updated hash

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: list, item name
# steps:
# delete item from list.
# output: updated hash

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: list, item name, and optional quantity
# steps:
# add item to list with stated quantity to the existing hash.
# output: updated hash

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: hash
# steps: iterate through the hash and put item and quantity on separate line.
# output: nil

# * I learned that pseudocoding can be a very important part of coding especially when working with someone else because it is a good way to be on the same page with your ideas.
# * There are different benefits to using arrays and hashes, but hashes are definitely better for items that also have a value.
# * A method returns nil unless you ask it to print or return something else.
# * You can pass strings, integers, variables
# * You can pass informatin between methods by using the same arguments.
# * I feel a lot more comfortable with methods after this gps.

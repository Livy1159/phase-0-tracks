# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

>Version control is keeping different versions of software organized and it is useful so that when you need to find something it isn't a crazy scavenger hunt.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

>A branch is a way to add different features to a folder and it makes it easy to discard branches that don't turn out well without discarding the entire project.  This is a good thing to use when you are kind of experimenting.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

>A commit is a way to create a save point in Git and a good commit message is clear on what the most recent update was.

* What is a merge conflict?

>A merge conflict is when two or more updates don't work together.
